# SQL_Writer
Simplifying SQL Query Writing 
Doing Rpetative Task of Writing SQL queries for N number of items which makes anyone to feel bored.
if we missed out any single statment on the go which makes any one to feel hard to sort out the skipped value.
If this is the case you are doing regularly Then I have made a solution for you by making things in single go.

The beauty of the tool is we can convert data stored in notepad  into SQL Query.
Points to keep in mind 
                      1. Keep atleast 2 or more space between each columns.
                      2. Keep each row in separate line.
                      3. Keep the data file in desktop and name it as sql.txt
                      4. Before storing SQL queries review it, untill the query is okay.
                      5. Enter 1 in console prompt when you are okay to Generate SQL file, else give some random Integer value to review the SQL query again.
                      
NOTE: Generated sql queries will be stored in SQL_Writer.sql file
